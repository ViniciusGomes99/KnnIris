# Iris Species Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify iris species based on the physical characteristics of their flowers. Specifically, it utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to distinguish between three types of iris species - Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica - based on sepal and petal dimensions.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the famous Iris dataset, a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936. It includes 150 samples from each of the three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

## Key Features
- **Data Exploration:** Understanding the Iris dataset by analyzing its structure and summary statistics.
- **Data Visualization:** Generating scatter plots to visualize the relationship between the features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width).
- **Model Implementation:** Applying the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for classification.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance using accuracy metrics.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them:
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
    ```
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts.
